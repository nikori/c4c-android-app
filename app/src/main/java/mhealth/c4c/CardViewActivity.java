Exposure incidents might place dental health care personnel at risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and therefore should be evaluated immediately following treatment of the exposure site by a qualified health care professional ");

Blood contains the greatest proportion of infectious blood-borne virus particle titers of all body fluids and is the most critical transmission vehicle in the health-care setting. During dental procedures it is predictable that saliva will become contaminated with blood. If blood is not visible, it is still likely that very small quantities of blood are present, but the risk for transmitting HBV, HCV, or HIV is extremely small. Despite this small transmission risk, a qualified health care professional1 should evaluate any occupational exposure2 to saliva in dental settings, regardless of visible blood. ");

Stated another way, 99.7% of needlestick/cut exposures to HIV-contaminated blood do not lead to infection. The risk after exposure of the eye, nose, or mouth to HIV-infected blood is estimated to be, on average, 0.1% (1 in 1,000).The risk after exposure of the skin to HlV-infected blood is estimated to be less than 0.1%. A small amount of blood on intact skin probably poses no risk at all. There have been no documented cases of HIV transmission due to an exposure involving a small amount of blood on intact skin (a few drops of blood on skin for a short period of time). The risk may be higher if the skin is damaged (for example, by a recent cut), if the contact involves a large area of skin, or if the contact is prolonged.<br/><br/>");
